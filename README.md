## 📝 About this project

This is my **first React Native application**, created to learn how to:

- 📡 Work with external APIs
- ⚛️ Understand React Native using **Expo**
- 📷 Integrate barcode scanning
- ⚠️ Automatically check for allergens in scanned products

### 📱 How does it work?

1. You select your allergies (e.g., gluten, lactose, peanuts, etc.)
2. Scan the **barcode** of a product
3. The app fetches the **ingredients using an API**
4. If the product contains an ingredient you're allergic to → you’ll get an alert ✅

## 🚀 Quick Start (with Expo)

You only need **Node.js** to get started!

### ✅ Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- Expo CLI  
  Install with:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```
- Expo Go app on your phone (iOS or Android)

### 📦 Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/allergy-scanner.git
   cd allergy-scanner
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install additional Expo libraries**
   Used for the barcode scanner:
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-barcode-scanner
   ```

4. **Start the project**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

5. **Scan the QR code**  
   Use the Expo Go app on your phone to run the app immediately.
